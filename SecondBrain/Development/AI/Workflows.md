No longer hiring junior or even mid-level software engineers. 

Our tokens per codebase: 
Gumroad: 2M 
Flexile: 800K 
Helper: 500K 
Iffy: 200K 
Shortest: 100K 

Both Claude 3.5 Sonnet and o3-mini have context windows of 200K tokens, meaning they can now write 100% of our Iffy and Shortest code if prompted well. 

It wonâ€™t be long until AI will be writing all the code for Helper, Flexile, and Gumroad. My guess is by the end of 2026. 

Our new process: 
1. Sit and chat about what we need to build, doing research with Deep Research as we go. 
2. Have AI record everything and turn it into a spec. 
3. Clean up the spec, adding any design requirements / other nuances. 
4. Have Devin code it up. 
5. QA, merge, (auto-)deploy to prod.
