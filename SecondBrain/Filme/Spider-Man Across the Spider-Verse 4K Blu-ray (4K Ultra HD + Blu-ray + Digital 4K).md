## Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse 4K Blu-ray Review
### This is one 'verse where Sony is putting the MCU proper to shame...

Reviewed by [Kenneth Brown](https://www.blu-ray.com/movies/reviews.php?show=author&reviewerid=43491), September 6, 2023

Forget *Morbius*. Don't even bother getting excited about *Kraven*. Set aside every other Spider-project on Amy Pascal's plate. Christopher Miller and Phil Lord's *Spider-Verse* series is the true heir to the MCU Infinity Saga throne. While Kevin Feige and crew at Marvel Studios wrestle with what to make of Phase 4 and now Phase 5, the Miles Morales series creative wunderkinds and their team of killer animators, smartly cast voice actors, quick-witted writing and sharp-eyed direction is setting the bar *high*. *Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse* was already considered by many to be one of the best *Spider-Man* films... scratch that... best superhero films ever made. But then along came a second *Spider* (and sat down beside her), a brilliant, bustling, booming explosion of a sequel that not only bests its predecessor but draws a line in the sand and challenges every superhero movie that will come after it. The one flaw? The only reason a 4.5 sits atop this review instead of a 5.0? *Across the Spider-Verse* ends somewhat unceremoniously on a massive cliffhanger. If the now-delayed *Beyond the Spider-Verse* is equally amazing (or by some cine-miracle, better) I'll revisit this review post-haste and bump up the score. As is, the second entry in Miller and Lord's multiverse epic isn't finished yet, and difficult to award a perfect score without having a fitting end to truly measure its excellence.

Miles Morales (voiced by Shameik Moore) returns years after the events of *Into the Spider-Verse*, sadder and lonelier than we left him without his multiverse-sliding Spider-pals to fill out his social circle. He especially misses best friend and crush Spider-Gwen (Hailee Steinfeld), whose absence really stings. Cue incursion-level threat the Spot (Jason Schwartzman), an initially street-level, portal-sliding baddie who hatches a plan to shatter the boundaries between the 'verses and wreak havoc across worlds. Miles is soon reunited with Gwen, now a rookie universe-hopping agent of law and order, and also meets her new boss: Miguel O'Hara (Oscar Isaac), aka Spider-Man 2099, a vampiric antihero more interested in re-establishing "canon" than in reunions or saving Miles' friends and family. Miguel isn't alone. He's flanked by an army of Spiders: one familiar -- Peter B. Parker (Jake Johnson), now with a bouncing baby girl strapped to his chest -- but most strangers, including Spider-Woman Jessica Drew (Issa Rae), Indian sensation Pavitr Prabhakar (Karan Soni), AI assistant LYLA (Greta Lee), living hologram-in-the-chair Byte (Amandla Stenberg), aloof and enigmatic Hobie aka Spider-Punk (a scene-stealing Daniel Kaluuya), cringey '80s comic webslinger Ben Reilly (a hilarious Andy Sandberg), and literally hundreds more (among them a web-shooting dinosaur, a mask-wearing cat, a gunslinger on horseback, a musclebound mini-gunning cyborg, cartoon series guest stars, live-action surprises, and other weirdos plucked from Marvel Comics and TV lore.

Surprisingly, *Across the Spider-Verse* isn't just Miles' movie, and it's better for it. It's as much a full-fledged Gwen film, with a twenty- minute opening sequence that not only focuses on the heroine but offers a truly touching, deeply moving "side" story involving her strained relationship with her father. (Look for obvious-once-you-spot-em signs that Gwen might just be a trans kid, which makes the heartstrings plotline with her dad that much more heartbreaking and tear-jerking.) With two heroes sharing the spotlight, you might think *Spider-Verse* would be overstuffed, overlong and overcooked... and you wouldn't be entirely out of order making the argument. But when the adventure in question is this carefully penned, this beautifully realized, and this spectacularly animated, the almost two-and-a-half hour runtime is a blessing, not a curse. I'd have happily spent another three hours in Miguel's spider-verses. Miller, Lord and their cohorts fill the screen with fun easter eggs, visual gags and, eventually, a seemingly endless array of Spider-Folk that will leave superfans frothing at the mouth and hitting pause to see who they can spot in the background. And it all ramps up with perfect pacing. Always dizzying and chaotic, but never so much so that it derails the central story. Family is front and center and the film takes its time with quiet moments, allowing drama and character beats to flesh out our heroes without racing off to the next action sequence.

And oh, what action sequences await. An early battle with an alternate Vulture would serve as a thrilling climax to any other film. Here it's just an early glimpse at the insanity to come. No two fights or chases are remotely the same. The film is as visually stunning as it is innovative, with each new world brought to life with different color palettes, animation styles and little touches that make it a cinch to identify where we've landed or who we're encountering in the vast multiverse. It might also be too many characters to juggle, if Lord and Miller didn't have such a deliberate hand on the wheel. Each supporting character is given just enough screentime to be memorable *and* necessary, with Miguel emerging as the true villain of the piece. It's clear which Spiders are key and which are filler, and without relying on the variety of Spider-people already featured in the first film (other than Gwen they barely appear, save Peter B. Parker in a lesser role than before). To grab hold of the review cliche of cliches, "I laughed, I cried, I cheered". *Across the Spider-Verse* is the sequel fans were hoping for, and it rarely, if ever disappoints.

Said disappointment only comes with the end credits, which arrive after such an emotional floor-drop (ooph) that the wait for the third film in the series seems grueling, especially now that it's been delayed, most likely into 2025. Be prepared to grimace when the screen cuts to black. Unlike *Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning*, a *Part 1* that still felt rather complete in its own right, this particular cliffhanger leaves the sequel feeling very, *very* unfinished. (Think *Empire Strikes Back*.) Is that a bad thing? I don't think so, although the risk is that *Across the Spider-Verse* will be diminished if *Beyond the Spider-Verse* underwhelms. (Like the *Matrix Reloaded* and its sequels. Although those who hate *Return of the Jedi* don't seem to take it out on *Empire*.) I'll reserve full judgement until the full story has been told. I can't imagine a trilogy topper that spoils the heart and soul of *Across the Spider-Verse*; in many ways it stands tall and proud on its own. But movie-magic rarely strikes thrice. Here's hoping Miller and Lord pull off the impossible and deliver a third film that bests both previous *Spider-Verse* marvels.

Despite the word "upscale" sitting in the tech specs at the top of this page, Sony's 2160p 4K video presentation is a jaw-dropping stunner of an encode that delivers reference-level high definition visuals. HDR10 colors erupt off the screen, flashing and pulsing with punch and power. Contrast is beautifully balanced, with rich primaries, inky black levels, revealing delineation, and vibrant, uncrushed reds. Detail is as pixel-perfect as it comes too. Every stray line and flick of the animators' pen is captured with crisp, clean precision. Textures are spot on, and every quirk in the intentionally sketchy, sometimes jittery, occasionally painterly line-art is captured without flaw. Skip to the second act chase sequence between Miles and hundreds of Spider- pursuers. Pause. Revel in every last Spider-Peep dotting the backgrounds, bounding from walkway to walkway, flinging webs at Miles, scrambling up the side of a monorail train or tumbling down the side of a reactor core. Better still, pause at literally any given moment. Nearly every frame of the film is a piece of art that could hang proudly on a cinephiles movie-room wall. I didn't catch sight of any banding, halos or unsightly artifacts. I noticed a tiny hint of pixelation here and there in my screenshots (probably just a product of .jpeg compression) but nothing when the film was in motion, or paused for that matter. Upscaled from a 2K source or no, *Across the Spider-Verse* is a 4K disc to toss in to wow your friends. It's as good as 4K any Sony animated presentation has looked.

God bless Dolby Atmos. Sony's 4K Blu-ray release of *Across the Spider-Verse* boasts a fantastic Dolby Atmos mix (complete with a compatible Dolby TrueHD 7.1 track for those without higher end surround sound setups) that you'll continue to feel long after the movie is finished. Dialogue is clean and clear, carefully and believably seated throughout the soundfield, and never overwhelmed by the sonic chaos that fills every speaker. Directionality is pinpoint flawless, with silky smooth pans, remarkable engagement, and an immersive soundscape that takes advantage of every channel. The environments practically (sometimes literally) swirl around the listener, creating worlds that dance and spin to life. Webs sling past your ears. Rubble tumbles into the streets. Explosions rip through the air. Shouting Spider-Pursuers leap from speaker to speaker. Electricity crackles all around. Not to get too hyperbolic, but goodness, what an experience. Dynamics are perfect, even when the mix threatens to grow too loud, too chaotic. And that's with a smart score and soundtrack infusing varied music into every scene. It all comes together to create a showstopper Atmos track that's almost, *almost* as impressive as the film's animation.

[![](https://images.static-bluray.com/reviews/28892_4.jpg)](https://www.blu-ray.com/movies/screenshot.php?movieid=339262&position=4)

The 2-disc 4K Blu-ray release of *Across the Spider-Verse* includes a number of special features on the standard Blu-ray disc. The film's audio commentary, though, is available on both the standard and 4K discs.

- ***Filmmaker Commentary*** - Co-directors Justin K. Thompson, Joaquim Dos Santos and Kemp Powers are joined by co- writers/producers Christopher Miller and Phil Lord for a lively, informative track that covers everything a fan could want to be covered. The five-some occasionally gets a bit too chummy and veer off into tangents but it's a welcome spark of liveliness that suits the animation exploding under the track.

- ***Creating the Ultimate Spider-Man Movie*** (HD, 15 minutes) - Writing, pre-production and the challenges of crafting a sequel to a game-changing film, as told by the filmmakers who worked so hard to push *Across the Spider-Verse* several steps farther without losing the magic of the first entry in the series.

- ***Obscure Spiders and Easter Eggs*** (HD, 6 minutes) - A quick (too quick) overview of the many (*many*) easter eggs and alternate Spider-Men (Spider-People? Spider-People? Plus Spider-Buggies?) that litter the film.

- ***"I'mma Do My Own Thing" Interdimensional Destiny*** (HD, 8 minutes) - Fashioning the rules of a multiverse rife with choices, inevitabilities and, perhaps, fate.

- ***Across the Worlds: Designing New Dimensions*** (HD, 8 minutes) - Creating unique worlds through varied visualizations, color palettes, animation styles, and more.

- ***Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Cast*** (HD, 13 minutes) - The voice cast stops by to discuss their characters, recording sessions, screen chemistry and more.

- ***Designing Spiders and Spots*** (HD, 13 minutes) - A look at the ethnicities, body types, animation styles, personalities and approach to heroism/villainy of the many characters in *Across the Spider-Verse*.

- ***Raising a Hero*** (HD, 9 minutes) - The family dynamics of *Across the Spider-Verse*.

- ***Scratches, Score and the Music of the Multiverse*** (HD, 5 minutes) - An all-too-short glimpse into the scoring and music selection of the sequel. Wish it was longer but at least some attention is given to the film's music.

- ***Across the Comics-Verse*** (HD, 8 minutes) - Adapting the Spider-Man comics for the screen.

- ***Escape From Spider-Society*** (HD, 8 minutes) - Behind the scenes of the incredibly fun (and incredibly crowded) chase sequence that tops the second act of the sequel.

- ***Miguel Calling*** (HD, 6 minutes) - A deleted scene in its early animatic form.

- ***Lyric Videos*** (HD, 5 minutes) - "Annihilate" by Metro Boomin, Swae Lee, Lil Wayne and Offset, and "Calling" by Metro Boomin, Nav, A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie and Swae Lee.

- ***Sony Previews*** (HD)
