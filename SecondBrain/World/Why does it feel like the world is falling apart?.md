“We've engineered a volatile world where Starbucks is completely unchanging from year to year, but democracies are collapsing and rivers are drying up.”

As modern humans we experience a different world and experience than anyone who has ever come before us. This is because we've inverted the dynamics of how our lives unfold. We live on a planet defined by local stability, but global instability. The hunter-gatherers that came before us lived in a world that was defined by local instability, but global stability, says political scientist Dr. Brian Klaas.  
  
As hunter-gatherers, their day-to-day lives in their local environment was unpredictable. Now we have flipped that world. We experience local stability, but global instability. We have extreme regularity in our daily lives. We can order products online and expect exactly when they're going to arrive. We can go to Starbucks anywhere in the world and it's going to taste roughly the same.  
  
But our world is changing faster than it ever has before. Consequentially, when things do go wrong, the ripple effects are much more profound and much more immediate. This is where that sort of aspect of global instability becomes very dangerous.

> The speaker discusses how modern humans experience a world with local stability but global instability, contrasting it with the past where people lived with local instability but global stability. They explain that our daily lives are more predictable than ever before, but the world is changing faster than ever, leading to more profound and immediate ripple effects when things go wrong. The speaker then discusses the limitations of linear thinking in understanding complex systems and introduces the concept of non-linear thinking and complex systems theory. They also discuss several assumptions that have been incorrect in understanding social change and how the world has shifted, making these assumptions incorrect not because they were wrong in the past but because the world has changed. The speaker concludes by discussing the sandpile model and the importance of understanding the interconnectedness and adaptability of complex systems.
