“Why is it that the quality of our information did not improve over thousands of years? Why is it that very sophisticated societies have been as susceptible as stone age tribes to mass delusion and the rise of destructive ideologies?”

We belong to a world that is more interconnected, and yet more volatile than ever before. The masses of information that make this connectivity possible present the largest and most pressing threat to humanity, says historian and the best-selling author of 'Sapiens' @YuvalNoahHarari.  
  
Sitting down with journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin @92NY, Harari discusses the way our information systems are flawed, and how, despite our leaps in technology over the past centuries, we still remain as susceptible to deception and delusion as our ancestors were thousands of years ago. Harari says that if we don’t fix the flaws in our information systems, they could drive us to total disaster.  
  
In an exclusive hour-long interview, the Nexus author discusses truth, AI, fears, our possible future, and key ideas from his new book 'Nexus: A Brief History of Information Networks from the Stone Age to AI'.

> The speaker, Yuval Noah Harari, is a historian and the author of the book "Nexus: A History of Information Networks from the Stone Age to AI." In the conversation, he discusses the idea that humans have the ability to build large networks of cooperation, but the way these networks are built can lead to the misuse of power. He argues that the real problem is an information problem, as giving people bad information can lead them to make self-destructive decisions. He also discusses the idea that AI will ultimately be used as a storyteller to tell untruths and unwise stories, and those who have the power behind this AI will be able to use it in this way. He believes that initially, it will be people who use AI in the wrong way, but if we are not careful, it could get out of our control and be used by AIs. He defines AI as a machine that can learn and change by itself and make decisions and create new ideas by itself. He believes that we are not far from creating such machines and that the potential for them to get out of control and manipulate us is a big issue. He also discusses the idea that humans are storytellers and that we are susceptible to fictional realities. He believes that information was supposed to set us free, but instead, it has been used to manipulate us and create destructive ideologies. He argues that we need to be mindful of the information we consume and develop mechanisms to slow down the technological revolution and make better decisions about AI. He also discusses the impact of AI on democracies and the arguments for and against a future in which humans only have relationships with AI. He expresses his worst fear about all of this as being trapped in a world of delusions created by AI.
