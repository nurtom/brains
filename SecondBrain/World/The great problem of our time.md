About the video: "I think we need a truly open-ended conversation with 8 billion strangers, and  
what makes that hard to do increasingly is a level of political fragmentation and extremism and  
partisanship born of our engagement with these new technologies."

Our culture has atomized: We’re all on our own with our phones, laptops, and digital media experiences. No one knows what everyone else is seeing. In some ways, these technologies have caused a shattering of culture, and we can’t seem to agree about our perceptions of the world, says philosopher and neuroscientist Sam Harris.  
  
To combat this, we need to secure some semblance of human wellbeing. What makes that an increasing challenge is the political fragmentation and extremism born from our engagement with new technologies.  
  
We’re witnessing a zero-sum contest between those of us who want to maintain open societies and those who increasingly want to build closed, belligerent ones that make it impossible to share space. We have to become more intelligent to deal with these threats without losing the values we seek to defend. That’s why dogmatism is an intellectual sin, and overcoming it is key to building a better future for us all, says Harris.

> The speaker, Sam Harris, discusses the importance of open-ended conversations and the role of conversation in preventing violence and maintaining civilization. He expresses concern about the increasing political fragmentation and extremism, which makes it difficult to agree on facts and shared goals. Harris argues that we live in a perpetual choice between conversation and violence and emphasizes the importance of persuasion and cooperation. He believes that most human suffering and conflict are a result of the stories people tell themselves and that our beliefs shape our actions. Harris encourages an open-ended and intellectually honest conversation based on facts and arguments to solve problems and make progress in human life. He also emphasizes the importance of understanding and training the mind to regulate emotions and respond effectively to the world. The speaker also mentions the sponsor of the video, Storyblocks, and their help in creating engaging videos.
