I'm Andres Acevedo and this is The Market Exit. During the migration crisis of 2015, the small country of Sweden admitted a very large number of refugees. What effects did this surge of migrants to Swedish have on the Swedish economy? To find out, I met professor Peo Hansen, author of the book "A Modern Migration Theory" and from our conversation, I realized that many of the economic models we use for assessing our economy and society are deeply flawed.  
  
In the conversation, we talk about the field of research called the fiscal impact of migration. We talk about the difference between real resources and financial resources. We talk about the so-called brain drain within the European Union. We talk about why politicians are so afraid of speaking the truth about migration.

> The 2015 European migrant crisis, triggered by the Libyan civil war, Syrian civil war, and the war against ISIS in Iraq, forced millions of people to flee to Europe and had significant political ramifications. Sweden, in particular, took in a large number of refugees, with around 17 refugees per 1000 inhabitants, compared to 0.2 refugees per 1000 inhabitants in the United States. Politicians and experts predicted that Sweden's economy would be negatively impacted due to increased costs of migration. However, Professor Peo Hansen, a political scientist at LinkÃ¶ping University in Sweden, found that these predictions were incorrect. Instead, Sweden experienced strong economic growth, with economic activity growing almost as fast as in China.

> The flawed predictions about the economic effects of the migration crisis were not isolated errors but exposed deep flaws in the economic models that politicians rely on. These models misunderstand how migration affects the economy and society. Economists use a method to measure the cost of migration by comparing the cohort of migrants to those born in the country and measuring how much they pay in taxes and how much they receive from welfare systems. However, this method is flawed because it considers only financial resources and not real resources, such as people, workers, knowledge, and natural resources.

> Professor Hansen argues that our inability to distinguish between symbol and reality is another reason for the faulty predictions about the fiscal impact of the migration crisis. We often confuse the world as we symbolize it with the world as it is. For example, money is a way of measuring wealth, but it is not wealth itself. The distinction between real resources and financial resources is crucial to understanding the effects of migration. Modern monetary theory suggests that where we have real constraints are within the real resources, and we should care less about false constraints we impose on ourselves with fiscal resources.

> Sweden, which has a net inflow of migrants, is often viewed as a loser, but this perspective is misguided. Migrants are a real resource, and any country that receives real resources is a winner. For example, 51% of the bus and tram drivers, 60% of the cleaners, and 30% of the doctors in Sweden are foreign-born. It is obvious that the mainstream view that it is costly for countries to receive migrants is misguided. However, migration is not always possible or desirable, as it depends on real resource constraints, such as housing, health care sectors, and schools.

> Professor Hansen's book, "A Modern Migration Theory," aims to change the agenda on the economics of migration and disprove the assumption that migration is a cost. Instead, he argues that migration is an addition of real resources.
