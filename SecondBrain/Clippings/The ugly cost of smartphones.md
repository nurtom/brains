Iâ€™m Andres Acevedo, and this is The Market Exit. In this essay, I talk about one of the biggest, yet often overlooked, costs of the smartphone era: opportunity cost.  
  
We all know that screen time has reshaped our livesâ€”but what are we giving up in the process? Instead of focusing on the controversial debate around whether phones are harming our mental health, I explore what we already know to be true: that the more time we spend on our screens, the less time we have for everything else.  
  
Weâ€™ll look at how smartphones took over the world at an unprecedented speed, how Silicon Valley designed them to be as addictive as possible, and why the real cost of excessive screen time isnâ€™t just distractionâ€”itâ€™s everything we could have done instead. I also reflect on my own experience of hitting rock bottom with screen addiction, how I broke free (at least for a while), and what we can do collectively to shift our relationship with screens.

> In the summer of 2010, a law student's life was changed forever when they received their first smartphone, an HTC Desire. The arrival of this technology marked a turning point in human history, as the smartphone quickly became a global phenomenon. Within less than 20 years, it reached near-universal adoption, with 4.3 billion people, or 53% of the world's population, owning one. The best engineers of the generation moved to Silicon Valley to maximize screen time, leading to the development of features like the like button, push notifications, algorithmic content feeds, infinite scroll, and short form video content.
> 
> As a result, humanity spends an average of 3.35 hours per day in Germany, 4.34 hours in the US, 4.77 hours in India, and over 6 hours in Indonesia on their smartphones. Researchers have raised concerns about the potential negative effects of excessive screen time on attention spans and mental health. For instance, Gloria Mark's research shows that attention spans have decreased dramatically, from an average of 150 seconds in 2003 to 47 seconds in 2016. Jonathan Haidt and Jean Twenge argue that this screen time is negatively impacting the younger generation.
> 
> However, the debate over the health costs of screen time is not uncontroversial. Researchers like Andrew Przyblski and Amy Orben suggest that the connection between screen time and mental health issues may be overstated. Despite this ongoing debate, it is clear that excessive screen time imposes a massive opportunity cost on humanity. Opportunity cost refers to the potential gain lost when one alternative is chosen over another. The more time spent on smartphones, the higher the opportunity cost, as the value of the time spent decreases the more it is used.
> 
> The speaker shares a personal story of hitting rock bottom in 2018 while living abroad in Washington DC. They realized they had spent nearly all their free time doomscrolling on their phone or chatting with friends from home, and had barely read a book since getting their first smartphone years ago. They decided to take action, throwing their phone under the bed and replacing it with an e-reader. This change led them to read Yuval Harari's "Sapiens," The School of Life's "A Job to Love," and David Epstein's "Range," which helped them learn new things and change their life.
> 
> The speaker acknowledges that excessive screen time is a complex issue with multiple layers. While some argue it is a technology and regulation problem, others believe it is a personal responsibility issue. However, the speaker also emphasizes the importance of societal norms in shaping our behavior. By changing societal norms, we can make it easier for people to put down their phones and reduce the overall opportunity cost of smartphones on humanity.
